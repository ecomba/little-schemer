The Little Schemer

This project is just my run-through The Little Schemer book where I take the questions
(not all of them) and express them in code.

I have added the test-manager library to be able to do the assertions that I need to do
to prove that my thoughs where correct.

To run it you will have to:

  * install MIT-Scheme (on a mac just port install it).
  * type rake
